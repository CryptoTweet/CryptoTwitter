                    <p>CryptoTweet&trade; is the Encrypted version of Twitter&trade;. It uses advanced cryptography techniques to prevent unauthorized persons to read your ETweets.</p>
                    <p>Who are you? We are a group of independent software engineers who worked on this project for nearly 2 years. Because of the #Snowden discovery we start working 
                        around the clock to get this project up and running.</p>
                    <p>Is this all? No, its not even close to what we have in mind. We thought it's better to release a working service with less features then a whole lot of features that
                        have bugs or don't work at all.

                        Because of the fact that we are a group of independent software engineers we don't care about your identity. We only have a few rules: <strong>No racism, no CP, 
                        no fighting, no hatred. Just keep it all cool and friendly!</strong> This way we can enjoy this way of safe social media for as long as we want.
